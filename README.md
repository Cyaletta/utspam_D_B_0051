Project skeleton for UTS Mobile (rental/purchase app style) with:
- UI pages (register, login, home, beli/form, riwayat, detail, edit)
- Pastel pink & pastel blue theme
- Local storage: SharedPreferences (for simple user data) + Hive (for lists like transactions & products)
- Minimal working examples ready to run in Flutter (replace package name if needed)

**How to use**
1. Ensure Flutter SDK is installed.
2. From project root: run `flutter pub get`
3. Run app: `flutter run`
4. Hive initialization is done in `main.dart`.

Note: This is a skeleton for learning. You may need to adapt Android/iOS settings and add Hive type adapters if you prefer strongly-typed storage.
